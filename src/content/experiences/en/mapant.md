### üìñ Background and challenges

As part of the LiDAR HD program, France's ‚ÄúInstitut National de l'Information G√©ographique et Foresti√®re‚Äù (IGN) is producing and distributing 3D mapping of all of France's soil and subsoil using LiDAR data. This data opens the way to new and innovative mapping applications.

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation

The Mapant.fr project aims to create the most accurate topographic map of France ever. The goal is to transform LiDAR data openly available, into a map complying with the ISOM 2017 standard, the most accurate specification for topographic maps. The resulting map can be used by the general public (hiking, outdoor competitions), as well as for professional applications (notably in forestry, where it can be used to map vegetation density).

As part of this project, I developed an open source software package: Cassini (cassini-map.com). To optimize map calculation time, it is implemented using the Rust programming language. The second part of the project consists in creating the infrastructure to distribute the computation on several servers.
