### 📖 Background and challenges

In 2019, Décathlon is launching the Géonaute brand, specializing in orienteering sports. In particular, the team is looking to improve the range of compasses sold by the brand. As part of an assignment via my school's Junior Entreprise, followed by a fixed-term contract, I carried out a research and development (R&D) study on how compasses work.

### 🏗️ Realization

- Reflection and documentation on compass design
- Compass dynamic behavior equation
- Creation of a numerical model for simulating compass physical parameters.

The high-end R900 compass model sold by Décathlon benefited from this R&D work.

### 🛠️ Technologies

- Python language
- NumPy and Pandas libraries
