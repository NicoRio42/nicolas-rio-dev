I'm an Information Technology Engineer with several years' experience in full-stack web development and geomatics. Specializing in end-to-end project management, I support my customers from understanding their needs through to delivery, while guaranteeing tailor-made, robust and scalable solutions.

With solid expertise in front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript with or without framework) and back-end (Node.js, SQL), I also have skills in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and mapping applications.

My strengths:

- Ability to manage projects from A to Z, using a rigorous methodology and meeting deadlines.
- Ability to make proposals and adapt quickly to new technical environments.
- Passionate about technical challenges, I'm always on the lookout for innovative solutions.

I am available for one-off or long-term assignments. If you're looking for an expert to turn your ideas into reality, I'm here to help!
