### üìñ Background and challenges

Orienteering is recognized by the French Ministry of Sport as a high-level discipline, and the French Orienteering Team supports the best French athletes as they prepare for international competitions. France is one of the world's top 6 orienteering nations.
Faced with developments in the discipline, and the growing availability of performance data, the French team is constantly on the lookout for new analysis tools. I designed and produced Routechoice DB (routechoice-db.com), to support athletes in their day-to-day technical preparation.

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation

Routechoice DB enables athletes to analyze their training sessions, giving them rapid access to relevant data and indicators:

- Map display
- GPS tracks
- Split times between control points
- Display of route options
- Specific KPIs to competitive orienteering

An administrator portal enables coaches to add and manage training sessions and competitions.

Since the 2023 season, Routechoice DB has been used on a weekly basis by the P√¥les France and French Orienteering Teams. Regular communication with the coaches of these structures has enabled the application to be progressively improved.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Application framework: Sveltekit with Typescript
- Database: Turso and Drizzle ORM
- Mapping interface: OpenLayers
- Hosting: Cloudflare platform (Wokers, R2)
