### üìñ Background and challenges

As part of a team of fifteen engineers, I worked on the development and maintenance of the main business application for a major French energy company. The application enables the remote management of industrial PLCs, as well as the retrieval and processing of data from sensors.

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation

As part of the team in charge of the application's web portal, I took part in a major migration project from ASPX .NET technology to an Angular/Spring Boot stack. The high technical and business complexity of the existing application and the tight delivery deadlines made this a very rewarding experience.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Legacy: ASPX .NET
- Frontend : Angular
- Backend: Java Spring Boot microservices
- Database: Oracle
- Data processing pipeline : Kafka Bus
